This report aims to build a simple predictive model for the number of entrants in a month given a year between 1996 and 2020, 
a port of entry, and a mode of transportation. 

In it, we will explore the data and draw inferences about trends, build successive linear regression models using multiple
predictors, and eventually validate the model to determine the true error of prediction.
